    Info for Torch.Sprite
----------------------------------------------

Quick Definition:
    Anything that has visual and behavioral
    characteristics within Torch, i.e. anything
    that really does something

Basic Usage:
    var mySprite = new Torch.Sprite(x,y); //create a sprite with an inital
                                          //x and y position
    mySprite.Bind.Texture("texture_id");  //bind the sprite to a texture
    mySprite.Bind.TextureSheet("texture_sheet_id") //or a texture sheet
    mySprite.Bind.TexturePack("texture_pack_id") //or a texture pack

    //or make your own class that inherits from Torch.sprite

    var mySpriteClass = function(x,y)
    {
        this.InitSprite(x,y) //when inherting from Torch.Sprite, you
                             //must call InitSprite with a valid x and
                             //y argument before you use any Torch.Sprite
                             //functionality, i.e Torch.Bind, etc.
                             //once this function is called, the Object
                             //will be added to the game that Torch is
                             //running
        this.Bind.Texture("texture_id") //now we can bind a texture
    }
    mySpiritClass.is(Torch.Sprite) //inherit Torch.Sprite
                                   //see the Inheritance.info file for info on 'is'

Usable Members:

    Bind: OBJECT,
        An object that has three methods for binding visual
        elements to sprites.

        Usable Methods:
            Texture():
                Binds a static texture to the sprite

                Args:
                    textureId: STRING, the id of the texture
            TextureSheet():
                Binds a texture sheet to the sprite that will animate

                Args:
                    textureSheetId: STRING, the id of the textureSheet
                    optionalParameters: OPTIONAL, OBJECT, see Torch.Animation.info
            TexturePack():
                Binds a texture pack to the sprite that will animate

                Args:
                    texturePackId: STRING, the id of the texturePack
                    optionalParameters: OPTIONAL, OBJECT, see Torch.Animation.info
    Rectangle: OBJECT,
        An object(Torch.Rectangle) that holds the position and dimentions of
        a sprite for drawing

        Usable Members:
            x: INT,
                holds x position of sprite
            y: INT,
                holds y position of sprite
            width: INT,
                holds width of sprite
            height: INT,
                holds height of sprite
