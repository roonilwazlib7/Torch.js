Some basic info on the Torch.Sprite class

If you want an object to be drawn in the game, it should
be a Torch.Sprite. Torch games maintain a list of sprites
and draws and update them. Sprites come with prebuilt functionality

Sprite Functions:

*   Torch.Sprite (constructor)
        args:
            x: REQUIRED, starting x position of sprite
            y: REQUIRED, starting y position of sprite

*       Torch.Sprite.InitSprite (prototype)

        Initializes all the core attributes and functionality
        of the sprite. If anything inherits Torch.Sprite, it MUST call
        InitSprite in the constructor

        args:
            x: REQUIRED, starting x position of sprite
            y: REQUIRED, starting y position of sprite

*       Torch.Sprite.ToggleFixed (prototype)

        Toggles sprite's 'fixed' property. If a sprite is fixed, its position
        is not adjusted along with the camera (a HUD, for example)

        args:
            none

*       Torch.Sprite.BaseUpdate (prototype)

            Handles all the core update logic of the sprite. If anything inherits
            Torch.Sprite and defines it's own update method, it MUST call BaseUpdate

            args:
                none

*       Torch.Sprite.Update (prototype)

            Usually overridden by anything that inherits Torch.Sprite

            args:
                none

*       Torch.Sprite.Draw (prototype) (DO NOT OVERRIDE!)

            Handles all the draw logic of the sprite

            args:
                none

*       Torch.Sprite.ClickAway (prototype)

            Binds an event when the sprite is clicked away from

            args:
                eventFunction: REQUIRED, function to be called when event is triggered

*       Torch.Sprite.MouseOver (prototype)

            Binds an event when the sprite is hovered over.

            args:
                eventFunction: REQUIRED, function to be called when event is triggered
