|   Ideas For Stratus |
-----------------------
**  The concept
    Stratus will be in the vein of the classic Metroid games, which is
    to say it will involve lots of unlockables for the character, puzzle
    solving and different worlds (or areas).

    Stratus will involve playing as a variety of fantasy races. (see below for list)
    Each race will have a corresponding 'world' that will require the unique
    abilities of that race. Once a race is unlocked, the player will be able to
    switch between them at his/her leisure.

    The ultimate goal of the game will be to unlock all the races, whose abilities
    will all be required in some sort of final battle. This is the main object of
    the game, but not the only one. The player will also have the chance to unlock
    additional items that will increase his/her power, but that aren't technically
    necessary.

**  The races
    Human, Dwarf, Elf, Wizard

**  Random Ideas:
    **  different classes of races
    **  doors can be opened by anything, or be accessible only to certain abilities
