Just some quick information about the games folder:
---------------------------------------------------

    The games in this folder were made to work out
    Torch. Do to the fact that Torch is very unstable,
    it should be assumed that none of these games really
    work.

    Ctf: Not quite sure where I am going with
         this one yet, but I'm pretty sure it will
         add to Torch.Particles

    MarioClone: Cloned some of the aspects of Mario,
                led to the creation of Torch.Platformer

    TorchGame:  Me messing around with platformer stuff,
                led to the most concrete collision detection
                for I platformer that I have ever done
